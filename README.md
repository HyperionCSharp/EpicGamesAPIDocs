# EpicGamesAPIDocs
Research about Epic's non-documented API. Documentation can be found within the _*docs*_ folder.

Want something documented? Open an issue and specify what you would like added and I'll try to get it added.
If you already have something documented and would like it added to the repo, feel free to open a pull request.

Thanks to MixV2 for the first Non documented API repo!! [MixV2 Original Repo](https://github.com/MixV2/EpicResearch)
